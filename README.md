# 1. Data Structures & Algorithms.
-- Data Structures - Arrays, Strings, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Tries, Heaps
 Algorithms - Searching, Sorting, Hashing(Hash Tables), Greedy, Divide and Conquer
 Other Concepts - Time Complexity Analysis, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Number Theory, Graph Theory, OOPs

# 2. Libraries for implementing data structures.
-- Like STL library in C++. For example which data structure to use for implementing trees, graphs, heaps, etc.

Python - https://lnkd.in/d8SD4T8Q

# 3. Problem Solving.
-- You can start practicing on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. Try solving easy questions first to gain confidence and build logic for problem solving. Later you can move to medium and hard level problems. Try solving DSA topics in this order:-
Array -> String -> LinkedList -> Stack & Queue -> Recursion -> DP -> Trees -> Graph -> Heap -> Trie

# 4. Problem Solving - Interview Specific.
-- Donâ€™t waste too much time in step 4. Try to solve questions on each topic to familiarise yourself with them. Wasting time in solving random questions will not help. Instead move to questions widely asked in interviews.
